Bitcoin 21 Digital Currency V1.0 (Tickers X21 / XBTC21 )

Bitcoin 21 (or 21 for short) is a 7th Anniversary advanced Bitcoin variant celebrating 7 years of the blockchain. Bitcoin 21 is the culmination of over 2 years research in digital currencies to create the perfect digital currency with the perfect ethical, moral, commercial and environmentally friendly components.

Features

Bitcoin 21 features the very latest POW/POS technology and advances the original bitcoin blockchain with unique specifications which make it the perfect digital currency, these include;

21 million Pow coins Bitcoin 21 features 21 million maximum proof of work coins.

Pow/Pos Hybrid This allows the coin to be mined from the source until 21 million have been mined (proof of work) at which point the coin will switch automatically to 100% Pos (proof of stake). The hybrid coin also means that any coins mined and stored in the wallet during its lifetime will create an additional stake.

SHA256 Algo Uses the same cryptographically secure algorithm as the original Bitcoin blockchain.
